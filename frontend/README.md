# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

TODOS-
1) trim the username and take a part of it if its too long.Ex- username: subhambanerjee, then make it- subham... or subhamb..
2) make an icon with a default user pic on the left of your username
3) make the username section as a hoverable dropdown that shows had options like profile and logout.
4) add a notification icon on the right of you profile section, to show all notification. implement a red dot counter on it based on the number of notifications.
